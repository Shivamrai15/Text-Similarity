THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE

LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.

COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN SEVERAL AREAS.
DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THE REVOLUTION OF 1789 ABOLISHED

FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF
SUPPLYING SUITABLE EDUCATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD IN THE 1980S; THE
STAFFING QUESTION, TEACHER TRAINING BEING SEEN AS MORE VALUABLE THAN ADVANCED
LIBRARY STUDIES; THE NEW TERM 'MEDIA CENTRE', APTLY DESCRIBING THE TRUE
FUNCTION OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY; AND FAIRY TALES IN EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
IS AN IMPORTANT AID TOWARDS LEARNING OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES AT THE

THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR NEW STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE. THE NEW PROCESS VIEWS THE
EXISTING SERVICE PROGRAMME, ESTABLISHES PRIORITIES, AND CONSIDERS
MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES WITHIN THE PROGRAMME. WHEN ALL LOCAL SERVICES
ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME LIMITED MONIES, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MUST USE THE

DOES RATIONALISATION MEAN CUTS IN STAFF?.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SERVICE POINTS OF
KOKKOLA PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SOON AFTER THE REORGANIZATION A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY
WAS OBTAINED AND THE WORKLOAD WAS INCREASED GREATLY. TWICE THE LIBRARY SERVICE
APPLIED TO THE COUNCIL FOR MORE STAFF AND WERE TURNED DOWN. IN 1980 THE
COUNCIL DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN O&M SURVEY CONCENTRATING ON THE STAFF
REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR
2 FURTHER SURVEYS: TO SEE WHETHER IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO INCREASE THE USE
OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICES AND TO LOOK AT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.

MOBILES. ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING ARE NOW CENTRALIZED AND LIBRARY SERVICES
LTD IS USED FOR MOST OF THE CATALOGUING. BOOKS ARE PROCESSED IN BRANCH
LIBRARIES. WHEN A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING IS BEING PLANNED THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS
IN RATIONALISATION SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: THE USE OF CENTRALISED

ON DEMANDS TO REMODEL LIBRARY CONDITIONS AT THE 5 'OLD' UNIVERSITIES
(TECHNICAL COLLEGES) IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.

THE 1979/80 LIBRARY GUIDE TO THE AACHEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS AT THE LIBRARY. AACHEN IS NOW A
UNIVERSITY WITH ALMOST 30,000 STUDENTS BUT THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS LARGELY
DECENTRALISED WITH MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN
REORGANISED AND REHOUSED, BUT MANY STILL NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THERE IS A
LACK OF CENTRALISATION AND COORDINATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND OUT MOST OF THE
'OLD' NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE NOT PLANNED, CAMPUS
UNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF LIBRARY STOCK.
LIBRARY GUIDES SUCH AS THE AACHEN EXAMPLE ARE OF GREAT VALUEAND SHOULD BE
PUBLISHED AT ALL THE LIBRARIES. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE SMALL
INSTITUTE LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WORK. LIBRARIANS ARE OF THE
OPINION THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT PLANS
AND LAWS FOR REMODELLING LIBRARY CONDITIONS SHOULD BEWARE OF GENERALISATION.

THE EXAMPLE OF THE 'MARBURG MODEL'.

CRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN INTRODUCING A COORDINATED LIBRARY
SYSTEM AT MARBURG UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY SUITED AS A MODEL FOR THIS
PURPOSE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE
THE 19TH CENTURY AND HAD BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXTENDED SINCE 1962; AND NEW
BUILDINGS FOR MANY OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES HAVE LED TO EXCELLENT LENDING
CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY INTEGRATING THE PRESENT 37 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IT IS

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED

ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.

IS A FITTED CARPET HARMFUL TO ALLERGIC PEOPLE?.

FITTED CARPETS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN NOISE.
BUT IF CARPETS ARE NOT KEPT CLEAN AND ROOMS WELL VENTILATED THEY CAN CAUSE
PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. NEW CARPETS DO NOT
CAUSE THIS TROUBLE. RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND SHOWS THAT CARPETS STAY
DIRTY EVEN AFTER GOOD VACUUMING. GIVES COMPARATIVE FIGURES FOR THE AMOUNT OF
DUST CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR COVERINGS, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THE

PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL, LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISED IDENTIFICATION HAS ALARMED MANY PEOPLE IN
DENMARK AS ELSEWHERE. UNDER AN 1978 ACT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE HAS
ALREADY ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS ON CATALOGUING AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES. THE MAIN
QUESTION CONCERNS THE LINKING OF BORROWER TO BOOK, THOUGH THIS WAS EQUALLY
POSSIBLE WITH OLDER ISSUE SYSTEMS. IN 2 RECENT CASES INVOLVING TERRORISM AND
MURDER, LIBRARIES HAVE RELUCTANTLY SUPPLIED POLICE WITH INFORMATION GENERALLY
REGARDED AS CONFIDENTIAL. THE LIBRARY OFFICE PROPOSES AN EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF
LIBRARIANS' DUTY TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, ABD STRICTER CONTROL OF
OUT-OF-DATE PHOTOGRAPHIC ISSUE RECORDS. WHEN COMPUTER ISSUE SYSTEMS BECOME
COMMON, SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE MORE EASILY OBTAINED, AND THE DANISH LIBRARY
COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE A BORROWER
ONCE HIS BOOK IS RETURNED. WHILE THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE 1978 ACT, ANY
FUTURE REVISION OF THE LIBRARY ACT SHOULD  STATE THE POSITION IN UNAMBIGUOUS

THE MEDIA INDEX: COMPUTER-BASED ACCESS TO NONPRINT MATERIALS.

ALTHOUGH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO NON-PRINT MATERIALS HAS BEEN A GOAL OF
LIBRARIES, COMPLETE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THE LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA
STATE UNIVERSITY, LOS ANGELES, SOUGHT A WAY TO ACCESS PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE
ELEMENTS OF ITS RECORDINGS COLLECTION. THE COMPUTER-BASED MEDIA INDEX WAS
DESIGNED WITH SEPARATE INDEXES FOR TITLES, SUBJECTS, AND ADDED ENTRIES

USEFUL TOOL AND IS READILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF MEDIATED MATERIAL.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

A TRUE ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIRES BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF AT LEAST 350-400
CHARACTERS PER TITLE, A MINIMUM OF 6 ACCESS POINTS, AND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
TERMINALS TO OFFER ALL USERS PROMPT ACCESS. A LIBRARY MAY DEVELOP AN ON-LINE
CATALOGUE BY PURCHASING SOFTWARE FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY OR JOINING A TURNKEY
SYSTEM WHEREBY A COMPANY PROVIDES ALL HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION,
TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE AT A CONTRACTED PRICE. ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN
EXAMINING THE OPTIONS INCLUDE DATA BASE CONTENT, FULLNESS OF RECORDS,
AUTHORITY CONTROL, ACCESS KEYS, BOOLEAN LOGIC, USER FRIENDLINESS, DISPLAY
FORMATS, SECURITY, AND BACK-UP PROVISION. LIBRARIES UNDERTAKING ON-LINE
CATALOGUES IN 1981 ARE PIONEERS.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS A STRICT CONTINUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT FROM
COORDINATE TO SYNTACTIC INDEXING. NOMINAL PHRASES ARE USER ORIENTED AND
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR COMPLEX TERMS. A NOMINAL PHRASE CONSISTS OF A NUCLEUS
WITH A LEFT-HAND AND/OR RIGHT-HAND ATTRIBUTE. ATTRIBUTE AND NUCLEUS CAN OCCUR
SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SAME HIERARCHIC LEVEL. THE USE OF NOMINAL PHRASE INDEXING
IS ILLUSTRATED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF 3 MANUAL INDEXING SYSTEMS-TITUS, CASIN AND
GERDOK-AND 1 AUTOMATIC SYSTEM-DETECT. IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING WITH NOMINAL
PHRASES A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS IS UNNECESSARY; EVEN SYSTEMS WITH

SURVIVING THE EIGHTIES: NEW ROLES FOR PUBLISHERS, INFORMATION SERVICE
ORGANIZATIONS, AND USERS.

(THE 1980 MILES CONRAD MEMORIAL LECTURE, PRESENTED AT THE 22ND NFAIS

RESOURCES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHOUT IMPACTING ADVERSELY ON SERVICES, SUCH

TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,

A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF

MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.

SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.

THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) WAS ESTABLISHED ON 1 JAN 80

MEDIUM. FROM THE START THE BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
BOOKS ARE SOLD AT COST PRICE BY THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
THE PROVISION WAS THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL REPORTS, ABOVE ALL THE HANDICAP
COMMISSION'S REPORT CULTURE FOR ALL, 1976. DIRECT LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS FROM

INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHING
PROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON A
RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;

THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION
AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAK
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES
1-3 YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1-10 YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION

LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA
OF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.

PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP

INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,

THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE.

CENTRALISATION IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE IN RSFSR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATE OF
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC). IN 1980, 2,200 CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS, (CLS),
OPERATED IN RUSSIA, UNITING 50,000 LIBRARIES. BUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITIONS AND
STOCK-EXPLOITATION HAMPER CLS. MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES COMPLAIN OF A
DETERIORATION OF ACQUISITIONS, ESPECIALLY OF FICTION AND CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE. BOOK-ORDERING DEPARTMENTS DO NOT FULFIL CLS ORDERS, BUT DUMP
UNWANTED BOOKS ON THEM. RELATIONS BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIES NEED
OVERHAULING. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR FULFILLING LIBRARIES' BOOK
ORDERS. INCREASED FINES MAY PREVENT LOSS OF BOOKS. CLS NEED BINDING EQUIPMENT
FOR BOOK REPAIRS AND SHOULD IMPROVE BOOK USE BY INTRA-SYSTEM BOOK-EXCHANGE,

A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES.

A GOAL OF LIBRARIES IS TO ASSURE THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANY USE
STANDARDS AS A METHOD OF ASSURING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES, BUT STANDARDS HAVE

A MEASURE OF LIBRARY PERFORMANCE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PATRON CAN FIND
THE MATERIAL SOUGHT. THIS PARAMETER, DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY, IS BEST MEASURED
BY SAMPLING THE EXPRESSED DEMAND. SAMPLING THE SHELF-LIST IS FAR LESS
INTRUSIVE, BUT FAILS TO PROVIDE DATA ON COLLECTION ADEQUACY, USER CATALOGUE
AND SHELF SKILLS, AND FACTORS INHIBITING AVAILABILITY (SUCH AS CIRCULATION).
DESCRIBES A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR ADJUSTING SHELF-LIST DATA TO REFLECT
EXPRESSED DEMAND RESULTS AND PRESENTS A WORKED EXAMPLE, EXPLAINING THE STEPS

THE LAW FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS ONE MORE ON THE ROAD FOR
LEGISLATING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.

THE NEW LAW CAME INTO EFFECT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1981. A LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS
TO SET UP A COMMITTEE FOR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. OUT OF 84 TOWNS ONLY 9 HAD SUCH
A COMMITTEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. ALL OTHER TYPES OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, 150 OF THEM, DID NOT HAVE ONE. THE DUTIES OF THE COMMITTEES ARE
THE OVERSIGHT AND INSTIGATION OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, COOPERATION BETWEEN
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES PUBLICITY, PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION, AND
BUDGET. FROM 1982 STATE GRANTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF AND ORGANISATION
COSTS. THE NEW LAW SHOULD EASE THE WORK OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS WHO UNTIL
NOW HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF MANY OF THE LOCAL CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES.

MUSIC IN THE LIBRARY.

EVERYONE WHO WISHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MUSICAL RECORDINGS OF INTEREST TO
THEM AND RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL. BUT SOME READERS NEED QUALIFIED
SPECIALIST HELP. MOST PEOPLE VISIT THE MUSIC LIBRARY HOPING TO FIND SOME SORT
OF CLUB. LIBRARIANS MUST ESTIMATE WHICH RESOURCES WOULD ACHIEVE THE MUSIC
LIBRARY'S AIMS. A LARGE RECORD LIBRARY AND GOOD TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ARE
ESSENTIAL. SERIES OF SLIDES ACCOMPANYING THE MUSIC CREATE A BETTER ARTISTIC
AND HISTORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD OBSERVE ALL NEW EVENTS IN THE
MUSICAL WORLD, MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS AUDIENCE'S INTERESTS AND
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACTIVITIES TO MAKE THE MUSIC SECTION A CENTRE

THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY' DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE AN

INFORMATION, REDUCE THE OVERHEAD REQUIRED FOR SEPARATE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS, AND
MAKE CONVERSION TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MORE FEASIBLE. PLANNING FOR COMPUTER

INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE NECESSITY OF PLANNING IS ILLUSTRATED BY
EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PROJECTS, AND THE SOPHISTICATED
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES OF TODAY COMPARED WITH THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE IN

GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZE

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE

ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW

SEMANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.

THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOT
PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHERE
WORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOOD
ELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOW
PRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBY
SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BE
OBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESS
INVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITE
TERMS, PLUS THE USE OF LINK OPERATORS; VARIOUS FORMULATION POSSIBILITIES ARE
ILLUSTRATED. AUTOMATIC INCLUSION OF AUTONOMOUS WORD STRUCTURES IS ALLOWED.

HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE

BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR

OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND

PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION.

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN
BROADER BASED JOURNALS.

SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT

THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICES
PRODUCTIVITY.

IN 1978, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITS
CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
FULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERY
SUCCESSFUL. A 5-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATION
AND VARIOUS TASKS; (2) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS OR
AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER
TASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTION
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TO
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.

EVALUATION OF THE ONLINE SEARCH PROCESS.

THE STUDY EVALUATED ON-LINE SEARCHING PERFORMED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING
EDUCATION. SEARCHERS WERE SELECTED WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING, FROM 3
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISATION, AND WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE. IT
WAS FOUND THAT MOST SEARCHERS HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SEARCHING, AND THAT
PERFORMANCE WAS UNAFFECTED BY SOURCE OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, ORGANISATIONAL,
OR EVEN SUBJECT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. THE MOST CONSISTENT SOURCE OF
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SEARCH ITSELF. REPORT NOT

PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES
AND THE FORMAT OF THE NEW PATENT INDEX, DERIVED FROM THE INPADOC DATA AND

A SET OF EXPERIMENTS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE COLON
CLASSIFICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION AND
RETRIEVAL OF PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM THE FULL TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. FULL TEXT
DATA BASES WERE CREATED IN 2 SUBJECT AREAS AND QUERIES SOLICITED FROM

LIBRARY STOCK AS A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL BOOKSTOCKS.

IN A PARTICULAR LIBRARY THE BOOKSTOCK IS A HETEROGENOUS ENTITY WHICH CONSISTS
OF MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND LANGUAGES, WITH DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL
AND REGIONAL CONNOTATIONS WHICH SERVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF READERS. THUS, THE
AVAILABLE BOOKSTOCK NATURALLY SUBDIVIDES INTO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES WHICH
BELONG TO THE SAME CATEGORY AND THE SUBJECT MATTER APPEARS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT CRITERION. LARGE LIBRARIES IN SLOVAKIA E.G. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE SPECIFIC READING ROOMS FOR PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK E.G. NATURAL SCIENCES OR
LIBRARIANSHIP. SPECIAL PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL PUBLICATIONS
SUCH AS THESES, RESEARCH REPORTS, INTERNAL TRANSLATIONS AND OTHERS. IN DEALING
WITH PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF READER USING
IT (E.G. CHILDREN), THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE STOCK (TRADITIONAL OR MICRO),
GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND THE FREQUENCY OF ITS USAGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL ASPECT
OF BOOKSTOCK IS WELL WORTH BEARING I N MIND FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

HAS THE 'IN-HOUSE' SYNDROME GONE TOO FAR?.

THE 1959 NATIONAL PRINTING STRIKE FORCED MANY COMPANIES AND ORGANISATIONS TO
INSTALL IN-HOUSE PRINTING UNITS, AND MANY LATER ADDED MICROFORM UNITS. THE LOW
AVERAGE QUALITY OF MICROFORM PRODUCED AND THE POOR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SUCH
UNITS, SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS IN THESE TIMES OF RECESSION AND INCREASING
COMPETITION IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MANY LARGE ORGANISATIONS TO CUT BACK
ON SUCH LUXURIES AND START TO SUPPORT SMALL LOCAL SERVICE BUSINESSMEN MORE.

PAPER PRESENTED AND THE MICROGRAPHICS IN BANKING AND INSURANCE SEMINAR,
BRISTOL, MAR 80. PRESENTS AN OUTLINE OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF THE
GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE COMPANY, A COMPOSITE INSURANCE COMPANY

IMPORTANT, SINCE, ALTHOUGH MICROFILM IS ACCEPTED BY COURTS, THE EVIDENCE ON IT
MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED. USE OF MICROFILM TO SAVE SPACE IN KEEPING RECORDS HAS TO
BE SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE. A PILOT SCHEME WAS LAUNCHED AT 5 BRANCHES, USING
16 OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SUITABLE TABULATIONS FOR MICROFILM. A REPORT ON
PROBLEMS IN THE USE OF MICROFILM WAS PRODUCED, HIGHLIGHTING RESISTANCE TO
CHANGE, AND CRITICISMS OF THE MICROREADER. A MODIFIED FRONT PROJECTION READER
WAS OBTAINED AND WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH ACCLAIM. THE CONVERSION OF COMPUTER

HOW SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROM
COLLECTIONS OF REFERENCE WORKS AND CLASSICS, BE CONCENTRATED ON CONTACT WORK
AND CULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS.

THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATION
ANALYSIS.
     
TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, AN
ANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKEN
FROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITED
TITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEEN
ANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, AND
SMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED AND
RANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;
MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARY
SERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE
DEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER AND
POSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIAL
OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.

POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO

ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE
STUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES
TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARE
CITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.
THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE
SPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVER
USED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TO

ATTITUDE STUDY OF ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS ON WORK-STATION ARRANGEMENTS.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED COVERING 75 ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS AT
A LARGE GAS UTILITY. THEY WERE ASKED TO GIVE PREFERENCE RATINGS TO ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGARD TO PANELLING, SEATING, BACKGROUND MUSIC, AND THE
LOCATION OF A TERMINAL ON THE DESK. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS PREFERRED
AN OPEN SPACE LAYOUT TO LAYOUTS WITH SOME PANELS, AND SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC TO
NO MUSIC. THESE RESULTS ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FINDINGS OF MOST PAST
STUDIES. AS TO SEATING ARRANGEMENTS, THEY GAVE THE HIGHEST PREFERENCE TO A
RANDOM ARRANGEMENT MADE INDEPENDENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S SEX OR SENIORITY. WITH
RESPECT TO THE LOCATION OF A TERMINAL, THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE OPERATOR WAS
RATED HIGHEST BY ABOUT 1/2 OF THE RESPONDENTS, AND THE CENTRE OF THE DESK BY

WITH BEING THE CATALYST WHICH HAS CAUSED DECISIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. IT
IS ALSO GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT WARFARE HAS A SYSTEMATIC IMPACT ON THE
